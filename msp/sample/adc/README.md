1. This test is used to verify the function of obtaining adc channel data reading

2. Operation method
eg: Enable channel 0 to channel 4, bit0 represents enabling channel 0, bit0 represents enabling channel 1, and so on, a total of up to 5 channels are supported;
#./sample_adc 0x1f


3. The log output result of normal operation is as follows:

   ADC Driver Test Example Successed.

The failure is as follows:
   ADC Driver Test Example Failed.
