config PCI_ENDPOINT
	bool "PCI Endpoint Support"
	depends on DM
	help
	   Enable this configuration option to support configurable PCI
	   endpoints. This should be enabled if the platform has a PCI
	   controllers that can operate in endpoint mode (as a device
	   connected to PCI host or bridge).

config PCIE_CADENCE_EP
	bool "Cadence PCIe endpoint controller"
	depends on PCI_ENDPOINT
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support the Cadence PCIe controller in
	  endpoint mode. This PCIe controller may be embedded into many
	  different vendors SoCs.

config PCI_SANDBOX_EP
	bool "Sandbox PCIe endpoint controller"
	depends on PCI_ENDPOINT
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support the Sandbox PCIe controller in
	  endpoint mode.
	  The sandbox driver act as a dummy driver which stores and
	  retrieves PCIe endpoint configuration as is.

config PCIE_AX650_BOOT
	bool "AX650 PCIe Gen2 controller"
	depends on PCI_ENDPOINT
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable Gen2 PCIe controller,
	  which could be found on axera SoC family.

config PCIE_AXERA_EP
	bool "AX650 PCIe Gen2 controller"
	depends on PCI_ENDPOINT
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable Gen2 PCIe controller,
	  which could be found on axera SoC family.
